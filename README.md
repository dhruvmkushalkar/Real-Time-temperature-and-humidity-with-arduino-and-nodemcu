# Real-Time-temperature-and-humidity-with-arduino-and-nodemcu
In this project I have used NodeMCU which runs on ESP8266 WiFi shield and accepts Arduino 
codes. I have used DHT11 sensor which senses real time temperature and humidity

Here I have connected my circuit to my common WiFi. The Arduino(NodeMCU) sends an IP 
address which we can type on the web server to view the desired output. Thus a wifi shield is 
necessary in my project.

To check the working do refer this video link:
